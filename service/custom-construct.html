      <p class="body">Many of our clients come to us with very little background in the construction process, however, they still want total control over the costs and final outcome of each phase of their project. For these clients our Construction Management Services provide an experienced team to manage every aspect of the construction project for a management fee. We will create specifications, solicit bids, provide costing, scheduling and construction advice at every step of the project and we will keep you appraised of project status with regularly scheduled progress reports.</p>
