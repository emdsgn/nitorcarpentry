      <h2>Sub Contractors</h2>
      <p class="body">Although we do all of the construction work, we do hire sub contractors for the electrical, plumbing, heating, cooling, and some masonry portions of the project. We have been working with the same companies for years and are confident that their work will be completed when needed and you will be pleased with the results. All of the sub contractors that we use are licensed and insured.</p>
