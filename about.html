    <h2>Customer Satisfaction</h2>
    <p class="body">We go the extra mile to make sure that each project, whether large or small, is completed on schedule and on budget. Establishing a budget, putting together a construction schedule, understanding the permit process and working through the many design decisions to be made, are just a few of the key aspects of our collaboration with our clients. Our ultimate goal is to have our customers return when they are ready to start their next project.</p>

    <h2>Sub Contractors</h2>
    <p class="body">Although we do all of the construction work, we do hire sub contractors for the electrical, plumbing, heating, cooling, and masonry portions of the project. We have been working with the same companies for years and are confident that their work will be completed when needed and you will be pleased with the results. All of the sub contractors that we use are licensed and insured.</p>
