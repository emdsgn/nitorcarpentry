      <h2>Build</h2>
      <p class="body">At Ottawa General Contractors, we build to last and we stand by our quality work. Each of our renovations comes with an industry-leading 5-year warranty – but we don’t think you’ll need it. From sourcing the right materials for new walls to fitting the kitchen sink, we have the right person for the job. As the build progresses, you’ll see different professionals working on your property, from engineers to painters, and decorators – each skilled in their chosen field.</p>

      <p class="body">Part of our full-service approach means that you won’t have to worry about finding a qualified electrician or a skilled bathroom fitter – we’ve carefully vetted all the people we work with, giving you confidence that you’re working with certified experts. With a whole team focusing on your renovation, you get top of the line communication. Throughout the project, we’ll keep you up-to-date on how your renovation is progressing, and you’ll be able to come to us with any questions or queries.</p>
