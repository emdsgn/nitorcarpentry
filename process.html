      <h2>OVERALL PLAN</h2>
      <p class="body">Our education process is one we are most proud of at NITOR. Since every project is unique, we will walk you through how the project can be done on time, and on budget. We will always start with a complementary quote for your project, and we will take the time to truly understanding your building needs. Over the years working in Ottawa, we have learned that our planning process is very unique, detailed and disciplined. We will work directly with you to create a project plan, which includes timelines, budget, and creative opportunities to be sure we help you build the custom home, make the right addition and / or renovate the way you want.</p>
